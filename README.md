## Note:
The backend of this app is served using the free service on Render. Due to this, it may take some time for the content to load. According to Render's documentation:

"Render spins down a Free web service that goes 15 minutes without receiving inbound traffic. Render spins the service back up whenever it next receives a request to process.
Spinning up a service takes a few seconds, which causes a noticeable delay for incoming requests until the service is back up and running. For example, a browser page load will hang momentarily."
